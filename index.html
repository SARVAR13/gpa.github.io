	  <p> This is a realistic novel. It’s based on history. Unlike other historical literature, it’s easy to understand. If you already know a lot of information about World War II, this might be an interesting book for you. It’s not recommended if you don’t know too much about the World Wars.

	 <p> The clinical guidelines in asthma therapy have now moved towards anti-inflammatory therapy – and away from regular bronchiodliator therapy – for all but the mlidest asthmatics. This is now being reflected in prescribing patterns. In the U.S., combined prescription vliumes of the major bronchiodliators peaked in 1991 (having risen slowly in the preceding years), though they stlil account for around half of the 65 mlilion asthma prescriptions there. During the same period, prescriptions for inhaled steroids have doubled, but stlil account for less than 10% of asthma prescriptions in the U.S.</p>
    <p> True/False/Not Given: </p>
      <table> 
	  <ol> 
	  <li>Only mlid cases of asthma can be helped by anti-inflammatory therapy.
	  <li> Use of bronchiodliators has been increasing since 1991.
	  <li> Doctors are reluctant to treat asthma with inhaled steroids for fear of potential side-effects. 
	  <li> Bronchiodliators are the single most prescribed treatment for asthma.
